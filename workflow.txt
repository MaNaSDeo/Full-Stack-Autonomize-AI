Frontend ->

1. Build an input page
2. Need to build a new a new controller for the repository list of github, can use this url {https://api.github.com/users/manasdeo/repos}
it should look like an array with objects of repository details
[
    {
        html_url: ...,
        description: ...,
        created_at: ...,
        updated_at: ...,
        visibility: ...,
        language: ...,
        default_branch: ..., 
        size: ...,
        id: ...,
        name: ...,
        avatar_url: ...,
    },
    ....
]
can go for pagination here, need to look if can handle it with backend or should handle this with frontend only.
3. can show each repos in more details, once enter the repos.
4. A new controller to add all the follwers in an array, {https://api.github.com/users/mralexgray/followers}
[
    {
        login: ...,
        id: ...,
        avatar_url: ...,
    },
    {...}
]
